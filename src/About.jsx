      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Oktay and I'm from Berlin, Germany. As a
          Full-Stack software developer, I specialize in creating visually
          appealing websites, apps and mobile games. My passion for graphic
          design isn't just a hobby, it's a key ingredient in every project I
          work on. Growing up bilingual, I developed a love for languages and I
          currently speak four of them fluently. I believe that this skill has
          given me a unique perspective and allows me to communicate effectively
          with clients from all over the world. One of my strengths is adding a
          personal touch to my projects by adding the client's identity and
          message into the design, creating meaningful and beautiful end
          products that are both eye-catching and user-friendly. In my free
          time, I enjoy exploring my other passions, such as photography and
          music production, which provide me with creative outlets. I am also
          very passionate about Web3 and everything related to crypto, NFTs and
          blockchain technology as I believe they have the potential to
          revolutionize business and online interactions. If you have an
          innovative idea for a project that needs to be developed, I would love
          to hear from you. Your vision can be turned into a real product. Don't
          hesitate to reach out and let's start a conversation about your
          concept. I'm excited to collaborate and help bring your ideas to life.
